Description: #' The term phenology in the data set title refers to the seasonal phenomenon of 
    the freezing and thawing of lake and river ice (also known as 'ice-in'/'ice-out' and 
    'ice-on'/'ice-off' data. Ice-out dates, or the dates of ice break-up, are the 
    annual dates in spring when winter ice cover leaves an inland body of water. 
    Methods are provides to enable convenient access to New England iceout data from 
    the 'USGS' (<https://me.water.usgs.gov/iceout_data>) and Minnesota iceout data from
    the 'MDNR' (<https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ice_out/index.html?year=1843>) along with
    extra Maine state data from 
    'MDACF' (<https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/boating/ice_out06.shtml>)

    'NSIDC' (<http://nsidc.org/data/lake_river_ice/>).
