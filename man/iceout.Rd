The term phenology in the data set title refers to the seasonal phenomenon of
the freezing and thawing of lake and river ice (also known as 'ice-in'/'ice-out' and
'ice-on'/'ice-off' data. Ice-out dates, or the dates of ice break-up, are the
annual dates in spring when winter ice cover leaves an inland body of water.
Methods are provides to enable convenient access to New England iceout data from
the \href{https://me.water.usgs.gov/iceout_data}{USGS} and Minnesota iceout data from
the \href{https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ice_out/index.html?year=1843}{MDNR} along with
extra Maine state data from
\href{https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/boating/ice_out06.shtml}{MDACF}
and a comprehensive global dataset (to 2014) from the
\href{http://nsidc.org/data/lake_river_ice/}{NSIDC}.
